## Project Overview

**Business Challenge:**  
Churn prevention is a core telecom objective. This project predicts customer churn risk using industry-standard techniques and delivers actionable, business-focused metrics and dashboards.

---

## Key Achievements & Metrics

- **ROC-AUC:** 0.78
- **Accuracy:** 79%
- **Optimal Business Threshold:** 0.42 (max profit per customer)
- **Profit Curve:** Visualizes financial impactâ€”threshold maximizes retention ROI
- **Explainability:** SHAP global and local plots; easily interpretable risk drivers
- **FastAPI Deployment:** Production-ready endpoint for real-time use

---

## Methods Used

- **Data:** IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset (public, real-world)
- **Feature Engineering:** Tenure buckets, monthly charges, support ratio
- **Pipeline:** Robust preprocessing (imputation, scaling, one-hot encoding), SMOTE for balancing, GradientBoosting model
- **Evaluation:** ROC curve, confusion matrix, classification report, profit curve
- **Model Explainability:** SHAP importance plots (global and per-customer)
- **Monitoring:** Feature drift detection (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test)
- **Deployment:** FastAPI endpoint for real-time prediction

---

## Business Impact

- **Increases predictive accuracy from typical 60%-70% to ~79%**, enabling earlier, more reliable retention interventions.
- **Maximizes profit per customer:** Determines the best business threshold for proactive outreach, boosting ROI.
- **Actionable explanations:** SHAP breakdowns provide sales and marketing teams clear risk factors for each customer.
